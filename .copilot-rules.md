# Copilot Rules

This file contains coding guidelines and rules for this project to help GitHub Copilot provide better suggestions.

## Tests

### Import Rules

- Always use full relative path imports for mock functions
  - Example: `import { mockFunction } from '../../../mock/services'` instead of `import { mockFunction } from '@/mock/services'`
  - This ensures clarity and avoids potential path resolution issues in test environments

### Test Execution

- Always use the command `npm run test <route to file or folder>` when running tests
  - Example: `npm run test src/components/header`
  - Example: `npm run test src/actions/auth/auth.test.ts`
  - This ensures consistent test execution across the project

## General Guidelines

- Follow the existing project structure and naming conventions
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Maintain consistent code formatting and style
